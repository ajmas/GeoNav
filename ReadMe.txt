GeoNav

A small project to read NMEA data from a GPS and provide the messages as an
event stream, suitable for consumption by 'higher-level' code. 

Currently experimental, though tested with Garmin eTrex (using a PL2303
based USB-Serial adaptor) and a Holux Bluetooth GPS.

Originally written in 2007.
