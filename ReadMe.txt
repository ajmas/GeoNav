GeoNav

A small, Java based project, to read NMEA data from a GPS and provide the
messages as an event stream, suitable for consumption by 'higher-level' 
code. 

Currently experimental, though tested with Garmin eTrex (using a PL2303
based USB-Serial adaptor) and a Holux Bluetooth GPS. Operating system
used was MacOS X. The serial library is RxTx.

Originally written in 2007.
