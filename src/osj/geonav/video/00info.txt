The package is an attempt to see if there is a way to insert GPS information into a movie.
The idea is that you would have a video of your movement, but with the movement being
displayed in a map on the side. While this could be stored in a separate file, it would
be nice if this could be part of the file, so it isn't separated.

Currently non-functional. It was originally written to use the Quicktime for Java API,
but given its current state I gave up on that. Need to identify if there is another way 
of merging this data and also extracting this data at playback.
